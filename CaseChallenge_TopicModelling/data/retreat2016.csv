article01,Tracing Consumers’ Decision-Making in Digital Social Shopping Networks,"Several online businesses consider integrating social network functionalities into their online store, thus creating digital social shopping networks (DSNs). Because friends tend to be trusted or have similar interests, one often expects that shoppers will leverage their connections to simplify choice making and enhance the chances of finding well-suited products. Unfortunately, there is little evidence or theory to justify whether, when, and how this might manifest. In this research, we address this issue by developing a model of how decision-making unfolds in a DSN. The model can be used as a basis for a research program aimed at explaining why, when, and by what means online shoppers leverage their social network or cease leveraging it. We outline the key features of an empirical strategy, which involves process tracing via the use of complementary techniques: navigation recording, verbal protocol and ocular activity."
article02,Validating Knowledge Filtering Processes in Electronic Networks of Practice,"Online forums sponsored by Electronic Networks of Practice (ENPs) have become an important source of information for individuals seeking solutions to problems online. However, not all information available in a forum is helpful or accurate, requiring knowledge seekers to evaluate and filter the solutions they encounter. Most forums offer peripheral cues to help knowledge seekers make evaluation decisions, yet little is understood about the information filtering patterns people engage in when filtering information on ENP forums. This paper reports the results of a pilot fMRI study designed to elucidate the neural correlates involved in evaluating both content and peripheral cues encountered on an ENP forum. The ultimate goal of this research is to better understand information processing patterns in online forums and how these patterns produce more or less accurate filtering results."
article03,Helping an Old Workforce Interact with Modern IT: A NeuroIS Approach to Understanding Technostress and Technology Use in Older Workers,"Older workers (defined here as 60 years of age and over) are experiencing major problems using modern information technologies (IT). These problems include greater anxiety and more stress when using IT. The proliferation of interruptions mediated by IT is especially problematic for them. Thus, this research has four objectives: (1) to develop a research model explaining which broad-spectrum cognitive mechanisms mediate the impact of age on stress in today’s interruption age, (2) to explain the importance of having interruptions appear at predictable locations on the screen so as to help older workers use IT with greater ease and efficacy, (3) to explain the importance of using calm interruptions (i.e., no animation or aural alert) to help older workers be less stressed and more productive members of the organizations they work for, and (4) to offer practical, concrete guidance regarding interruption design and organization to software engineers and managers."
article04,Mobile Multitasking Distraction: A Pilot Study with Intracranial Electroencephalography,Texting while walking is a widespreadand dangerous behaviour. Efforts are being put towards the development of mobile applications to refrain users from engaging in this behavior. The study of the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying this behavior will help developers aim specific cognitive processes. This study uses intracranial electroencephalography to increase our spatial understanding of the processes implicated in mobile multitasking. We asked a subject implanted with 128 electrodes to engage in a texting conversation while having to discriminate a point-light walker’s direction. We discuss our results and methodological learning from this pilot study.
article05,Impact of Cognitive Workload and Emotional Arousal on Performance in Cooperative and Competitive Interactions,"We examine whether changes in the social environment (competitiveor cooperative), affect the relationship between the internal state (cognitive workload and emotional arousal), and the performance in a given task. In a controlled experimental game setting, participants played cooperatively and competitively with different partners. EEG activity and heart rate changes measured cognitive workload and emotional arousal respectively. Cognitive workload was associated negatively with performance in the competitive but not the cooperative mode. By contrast, arousal was associated negatively with performance in the cooperative mode but not the competitive mode."
article06,It All Blurs Together: How the Effects of Habituation Generalize Across System Notifications and Security Warnings,"Habituation to security warnings the diminished response to a warning with repeated exposures is a well-recognized problem in information security. However, the scope of this problem may actually be much greater than previously thought because of the neurobiological phenomenon of generalization. Whereas habituation describes a diminished response with repetitions of the same stimulus, generalization occurs when habituation to one stimulus carries over to other novel stimuli that are similar in appearance. Because software user interface guidelines call for visual consistency, many notifications and warnings share a similar appearance. Unfortunately, generalization suggests that users may already be deeply habituated to a warning they have never seen before because of exposure to other notifications. In this work-in-progress study, we propose an eye tracking and fMRI experiment to examine how habituation to frequent software notifications generalizes to infrequent security warnings, and how security warnings can be designed to resist the effects of generalization."
article07,Combating the Influence of the Heuristic Thinking in Online Star Ratings: Preliminary Evidence,"Online reviews, often considered more credible and less biased than marketing information, have become an important aspect of making purchase decisions. Yet, online star ratings can be affected by reviewers’ heuristic evaluations, potentially leading to suboptimal purchase decisions. For example, star ratings may be biased due to the availability heuristic, i.e., users giving disproportionate weight to one—often negative—attribute. As research has demonstrated that even minor modifications of the presentation of options can have a large influence on people’s behavior, we test the effects of prior attribute rating on overall star rating. An experiment (n 1⁄4 56) conducted in the context of restaurant ratings showed that merely asking people first to rate individual attributes can significantly influence overall ratings. These findings can have important implications, as uncovering the effects specific design parameters of review forms have on people’s evaluation results will allow for reducing unintended biases in review form design."
article08,"Mobile BCI Technology: NeuroIS Goes Out of the Lab, into the Field","In the past years many NeuroIS studies have been published using different neuroimaging tools like electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In general most of the EEG studies have been performed in the lab, where participants are mounted with EEG sensors sitting in front of the computer and following the presented instructions. There are several mobile EEG systems on the market which could be used to investigate brain activity of human behaviour in the field, like during sports or social activities. In this paper we will present a novel system for EEG-based NeuroIS studies out of the lab, named mobile NeuroIS. The system consists of a wireless EEG system and a smartphone, serving as a monitor. Beside the system architecture we will present first evaluation data of three participants using it as mobile Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) application."
article09,Exploring the Mental Load Associated with Switching Smartphone Operating Systems,"The increasing importance of the smartphone industry has led many to debate which leading mobile platform, iOS or Android, is best. One of the central arguments is that perceived ease of use of the device should be the principle consideration. To measure this, one can reference Cognitive Load Theory and employ EEGs to register the mental load associated with completing common smartphone tasks such as making a call or navigating to a web page. The proposed study aims to evaluate the mental load associated with a set of tasks performed on a smartphone by a user who is unfamiliar with the operating system. It is our belief that this initial measure of mental load will act as a surrogate for which operating system embodies the idea of universal usability."
article10,Samsung Versus Apple: Smartphones and Their Conscious and Non-conscious Affective Impact,"Traditional market research used to focus on survey-based investigations. The first generation of Neuromarketing focused on Brain Imaging via functional Magnet Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which allowed for a true insight into brain activities with accurate localisation results. Finally, the new generation of Neuromarketing provides valuable information about implicit affective responses, which in combination with explicit responses are most useful for product evaluation and many further economic decisions. This study investigated various aspects of Samsung and Apple smartphones with respect to their conscious and unconscious affective impact in response to visual presentations. Besides various interesting discrepancies between conscious and unconscious affective responses, which demonstrate that mainly conscious cognitive differences exist between Apple and Samsung, an overall outcome is that male Samsung owners demonstrated most positive nonconscious affective processing levels regardless of which brand and version being exposed to."
article11,Neural Correlates of Technological Ambivalence: A Research Proposal,"Individuals’ reactions to a new technology have been studied extensively in information systems and other literatures. We suggest that one of the possible dispositions to a new technology, ambivalence, has not been studied much in the information systems research. Ambivalence refers to a state of having both positive and negative orientations toward an object simultaneously. Our conjecture is that it is possible for an individual to have such a reaction toward a new technology. In addition to having both positive and negative orientations, ambivalence may also represent as cognition and/or emotion. We suggest that such a complex reaction and/or state can be better understood using a neurophysiological approach because this approach will help us disentangle various facets and temporal dynamics of ambivalence. In this proposed research, we seek to conduct an empirical study to understand the neural correlates of ambivalence toward a technology."
article12,Neuroscience Foundations for Human Decision Making in Information Security: A General Framework and Experiment Design,"In this paper, we propose a conceptual model for information security (InfoSec) decision making that is based on cognitive science and neuroscience, and present a comprehensive framework of InfoSec decision making process. In addition, we illustrate a specific experiment design that could be used to investigate how specific automatic affective processes would impact specific components of the InfoSec decision making process."
article13,Combining Vicarious and Enactive Training in IS: Does Order Matter?,"The objective of the article is to provide empirical support for curriculum development to instructors using enactive learning in IS. Specifically, we are interested in understanding which instructional design, combining enactive and vicarious learning, leads to the most effective learning achievement and development of self-efficacy. Specifically, we compare two different training sequences to determine which is the best combination of the two instructional designs (vicarious/ enactive) to train people in using business dashboards efficiently. In a controlled lab environment, we collected (1) behavioral data (performance, software interactions) (2) oculometric data and (3) self-assessed self-efficacy data to assess the learning processes and strategies. Our results show that providing the vicarious training first when using a combination of enactive and vicarious learning leads to a higher selfefficacy increase. It also has a significant impact on the attentional efficiency of students using dashboards in a business setting."
article14,The Relationship Between Visual Website Complexity and a User’s Mental Workload: A NeuroIS Perspective,"I report results from an experiment on the relationship between visual website complexity and users’ mental workload. Applying a pupillary based workload assessment as a NeuroIS methodology, I found indications that a balanced level of navigation complexity, i.e., the number of (sub)menus, in combination with a balanced level of information complexity, is the best choice from a user’s mental workload perspective."
article15,Studying the Creation of Design Artifacts,"As software and information systems (IS) increase in functional sophistication, perceptions of IS quality are changing. Moving beyond issues of performance efficiency, essential qualities such as fitness for purpose, sustainability, and overall effectiveness become more complex. Creating software and information systems represents a highly interconnected locus in which both the generative processes of building design artifacts and articulating constructs used to evaluate their quality take place. We address this interconnectedness with an extended process-oriented research design enabling multi-modal neurophysiological data analyses. We posit that our research will provide more comprehensive assessments of the efficacy of design processes and the evaluation of the qualities of the resulting design artifacts."
article16,Bridging Aesthetics and Positivism in IS Visual Systems Design with Neuroscience: A Pluralistic Research Framework and Typology,"In this paper, we proposed a neuroscience-based general framework for IS visual systems design that uses neuroscience as the bridge that systematically integrates the principles of design aesthetics and principles of positivistic functionalities into a comprehensive model. Based on our general conceptual model, we also provide a detailed typological framework for the practical IS visual systems design."
article17,Towards a General-Purpose Mobile Brain-Body Imaging NeuroIS Testbed,"Navigating (familiar) environments requires spatial memory and spatial orientation. Mobile information systems (IS) have largely taken on this task and have changed human behavior. What impact has the redistribution of problem solving on human skills and knowledge? We are interested in exploring how the use of IS impacts on knowledge/ignorance by means of mobile brain-body imaging. In this paper, we introduce a novel experimental testbed developed to study spatial orientation in the context of geographic maps. Key system features include data synchronization between various devices and data sources, flexibility in designing and modeling research questions and integration of online co-adaptive brain-computer interfacing (BCI) technology. Flexibility, adaptability, scalability and modifiability of the implemented system turn the testbed into a general-purpose tool for studying NeuroIS constructs."
article18,Differences in Reading Between Word Search and Information Relevance Decisions: Evidence from Eye-Tracking,"We investigated differences in reading strategies in relation to information search task goals and perceived text relevance. Our findings demonstrate that some aspects of reading when looking for a specific target word are similar to reading relevant texts to find information, while other aspects are similar to reading irrelevant texts to find information. We also show significant differences in pupil dilation on final fixations on relevant words and on relevance decisions. Our results show feasibility of using eye-tracking data to infer timing of decisions made on information search tasks in relation to the required depth of information processing and the relevance level."
article19,The Influence of Task Characteristics on Multiple Objective and Subjective Cognitive Load Measures,"Using Electroencephalography (EEG), this study aims at extracting three features from instantaneous mental workload measure and link them to different aspect of the workload construct. An experiment was designed to investigate the effect of two workload inductors (Task difficulty and uncertainty) on extracted features along with a subjective measure of mental workload. Results suggest that both subjective and objective measures of workload are able to capture the effect of task difficulty; however only accumulated load was found to be sensitive to task uncertainty. We discuss that the three EEG measures derived from instantaneous workload can be used as criteria for designing more efficient information systems."
article20,Using Contactless Heart Rate Measurements for Real-Time Assessment of Affective States,"Heart rate measurements contain valuable information about a person’s affective state. There is a wide range of application domains for heart rate-based measures in information systems. To date, heart rate is typically measured using skin contact methods, where users must wear a measuring device. A non-contact and easy to use mobile approach, allowing heart rate measurements without interfering with the users’ natural environment, could prove to be a valuable NeuroIS tool. Hence, our two research objectives are (1) to develop an application for mobile devices that allows for non-contact, real-time heart rate measurement and (2) to evaluate this application in an IS context by benchmarking the results of our approach against established measurements. The proposed algorithm is based on non-contact photoplethysmography and hence takes advantage of slight skin color variations that occurs periodically with the user’s pulse."
article21,Lifelogging as a Viable Data Source for NeuroIS Researchers: A Review of Neurophysiological Data Types Collected in the Lifelogging Literature,"Based on this review, we argue for the consideration of lifelogging as an additional data source in NeuroIS research. Lifelogging itself is a concept which describes a behavior in which individuals, based on the use of computer technology, track (parts of) their lives, including the quantification of their well-being (e.g., continuous recording of an individual’s heart rate via a digital wrist watch). This relatively new form of behavior generates a viable data source for future NeuroIS studies, predominantly for those conducted in field settings. By analyzing how frequently the major types of neurophysiological data have thus far been collected in lifelogging publications, we reveal how much attention different types of neuro-physiological data have received in the context of longitudinal field studies. In essence, lifelogging data constitute a viable data base for NeuroIS researchers, one that is readily available and is predicted to grow in the future because an increasing number of people worldwide are tracking their daily lives to a growing extent."
article22,"A Refined Examination of Worker Age and Stress: Explaining How, and Why, Older Workers Are Especially Techno-Stressed in the Interruption Age","The workforce is aging rapidly, with the number of older workers increasing sharply (older being defined as 60 and over). At the same time, interruptions mediated by modern information technologies are proliferating in organizations. These interruptions include email notifications and instant messages, amongst others, which have been shown to have hazardous consequences for employees in terms of stress. Older workers might be especially affected by these interruptions, implying major problems for this fast-growing user group with regard to their well-being and work performance. The present study tests a research model suggesting that older workers experience more interruption-based technostress than their younger counterparts because of differences in inhibitory control between older and younger adults. In doing so, this study answers recent calls for examining age as a substantive variable in IS research, and it contributes to the literature on technostress by showing how technostress affects different user groups to different extents."
article23,Consumer Grade Brain-Computer Interfaces: An Entry Path into NeuroIS Domains,"This research provides a high-level and non-technical insight into the current state of NeuroIS field and a concise overview of consumer grade Brain-Computer interfaces (BCI). Special attention is given to the electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs. Additionally, a two-dimensional overview with five clusters (Surgical, Clinical, Lab, Office and Plug & play cluster) is proposed as a mean to position NeuroIS tools based on the resource requirements and ease of use. Finally, this research employs a consumer grade BCI (Neurosky Mindwave) in a pilot study and argues for future research on consumer grade BCIs for topics related to information overload."
article24,Measuring the Popularity of Research in Neuroscience Information Systems (NeuroIS),Research in Neuroscience Information Systems aka NeuroIS has gained considerable momentum in the past decade. The purpose of this study is to examine the landscape of research conducted in the emerging discipline of NeuroIS in order to track the progression in the field. Our analysis is based on a systematic review of 59 papers published in high impact conferences and journals over the past 5 years (2011 to 2015 inclusive). It offers a bird eye view to the upcoming researchers who intend to pursue NeuroIS research.

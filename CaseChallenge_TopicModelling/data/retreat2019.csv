article01,Circadian Rhythms and Social Media Information-Sharing,"Large amounts of information are shared through social media. Such communication assumes users are sufficiently aligned, not only in terms of their interests but also in terms of their emotional and cognitive states. It is not clear how this emotional and cognitive alignment is achieved for social media, given one-to-one interactions are infrequent and discussion often spans loosely connected individuals. This study argues that circadian rhythms play an important physiological role in aligning users for information-sharing, as information shared at different times of the day is likely to encounter users with common physiological states. Data are gathered from Twitter to examine patterns of sentiment and text complexity in social media, as well as how these patterns affect information-sharing. Results suggest the timing of a social media post, relative to collective patterns of sentiment and text complexity, is a better predictor of information-sharing than the sentiment and text complexity of the post itself. Put differently, information is more likely to be shared when it is posted at times of the day when other users are primed for emotion and concentration, independent of whether that posted information is itself emotional or demanding in concentration."
article02,Does a Social Media Abstinence Really Reduce Stress? A Research-in-Progress Study Using Salivary Biomarkers,"There is much scientific evidence in recent years indicating that our ‘always on’ culture powered by platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp, is leading to negative health outcomes, particularly stress. To mitigate social media induced stress, people are being advised to abstain from using social media for a period of time. However, the effectiveness of such breaks is open to question. As many people are heavily dependent on social media, the inability to access these platforms for a period of time could actually create stress and anxiety. To determine if and how social media abstinence relates to stress, this project will investigate the role of passion as a mediating variable. Stress will be measured using a combination of the salivary biomarkers cortisol and alpha amylase, with psychological scales. Ultimately, this study aims to determine the boundary conditions under which an abstinence from social media use will either increase or decrease stress levels in working professionals."
article03,Multicommunicating During Team Meetings and Its Effects on Team Functioning,"This research-in-progress examines the phenomenon of multicommunicating during team meetings (Meeting MC). Drawing upon social interdependence theory, multilevel theorizing, and research on multitasking, we examine the positive and negative effects of Meeting MC on individual team members’ reactions, as well as on team processes and team outcomes. We propose a two-phase experimental approach to investigate the individual-level affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses in other team members, as well as the how these individual-level effects of Meeting MC spill over and affect team-level functioning and performance. This research advances our understanding of Meeting MC and how it affects individuals and groups. It also provides guidelines to managers and decision makers to leverage the beneficial aspects of Meeting MC while limiting and mitigating its detrimental effects."
article04,A Neuroimaging Study of How ICT-Enabled Interruptions Induce Mental Stress,"In modern society, information and communication technologies (ICTs) provide individuals with social connectivity and facilitate their task execution either in daily life or work. While ICTs bring about numerous benefits, the technologies can expose individuals to frequent interruptions which disrupt thinking processes and potentially cause mental stress. Even though Information Systems research has investigated the effect of interruptions on stress, the neural mechanism underlying how ICT-enabled interruptions induce individuals’ mental stress remains to be further revealed. Accordingly, this neuroimaging study aims to examine the neural activation associated with mental stress in response to ICT-enabled interruptions by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). Furthermore, this research distinguishes the neural activation patterns with regard to quantity and task relevancy of ICT-enabled interruptions."
article05,User Performance in the Face of IT Interruptions: The Role of Executive Functions,"Information systems (IS) research has studied the consequences of IT interruption on user performance. However, our knowledge thus far of the cognitive mechanisms involved in processing different interruption types is limited. In response to this research gap, the present research-in-progress paper proposes that IT intrusions (unnecessary interruptions) and IT interventions (relevant interruptions) impose different types of load on users’ cognitive resources. The study employs a self-regulation framework and borrows from the literature on executive functions (EFs), which are a set of general-purpose cognitive processes that control thought and actions. The moderating role of individuals’ differences in terms of three EF capabilities as well as the effect of EF loads on task performance are hypothesized. A three-factor (Interruption Frequency × Interruption Type × Executive Function Capability) mixed-design experiment using electroencephalography is proposed to test the generated hypotheses."
article06,Investigating the Role of Mind Wandering in Computer-Supported Collaborative Work: A Proposal for an EEG Study,"Mind wandering is a mental activity that allows us to easefully escape from current situations and tasks. Being the opposite of goal-directed thinking, existing research suggests that mind wandering is an important antecedent of creativity and innovation behavior. Moreover, there is initial evidence that technology characteristics may influence mind wandering. Despite a growing academic interest in mind wandering, there is only limited research that provides insights into the relationship between technology characteristics and mind wandering. We seek to address this research gap by proposing a research model that investigates whether technology supported collaborative work has an impact on the degree of mind wandering. In this research-in-progress paper, we describe the use of self-report measures and neurophysiological measures (specifically, Electroencephalography, EEG) to study mind wandering in an Information Systems research context. Ultimately, our research seeks to inform design science research in order to enhance creativity and innovation behavior."
article07,The Effect of Technology on Human Social Perception: A Multi-methods NeuroIS Pilot Investigation,"Effects of digital communication have been reported, but with only little physiological data backing. The purpose of this pilot study was to use a multi-methods approach to investigate in digital natives the effects of reading from a mobile device, listening to an audio recording and listening to an actual person present, who reads out loud. Self-reported pleasantness and arousal as conscious data, startle reflex modulation, skin conductance and heart rate as non-conscious data were recorded for each condition. The findings indicate that physiological arousal measures tend to match respective self-report measures both indicating higher arousal levels for social conditions. However, physiological valence measures do not match their corresponding self-report measures. Listening to an audio recording and listening to a real person reading were rated as more pleasant than reading alone. However, listening to a present person reading out loud resulted in the most negative subcortical raw affective responses in digital native’s brains."
article08,Intelligent Invocation: Towards Designing Context-Aware User Assistance Systems Based on Real-Time Eye Tracking Data Analysis,"Recently introduced virtual and augmented reality devices such as the HTC Vive Pro Eye or Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 come with integrated eye tracking technology. Eye tracking technology is thus closer to the consumer market than ever before. Should these systems make the leap into the end consumer market, possibilities also evolve to use the data to feed intelligent user assistance systems in real time. One application could be to detect phases in consumers’ decision making processes based on eye tracking data, which, in turn, can be used to offer context-aware assistance to consumers. By analyzing eye tracking data from an experiment in a virtual reality shopping environment, we test existing approaches to detect decision phases and evaluate their applicability for an intelligent invocation of real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we propose a new approach, called on-the-fly-detection, since we conclude that existing approaches are not suitable for real-time phase detection."
article09,Designing Self-presence in Immersive Virtual Reality to Improve Cognitive Performance—A Research Proposal,"With the increasing availability of immersive virtual reality (IVR) technologies, new opportunities to change individuals’ behavior become possible. Notably, recent research showed that by creating a full-body ownership illusion of a virtual avatar looking similar to Einstein, users’ cognitive performance can be enhanced. However, although research is quite consistent in reporting that visuomotor synchrony in IVR achieved with body tracking suffices to elicit body ownership illusions that change behavior, it is still unclear whether strengthening these visuomotor illusions with additional technological design elements, such as visuotactile feedback, can contribute to increase desired outcomes even more. In this research in progress paper, we aim to conduct a 2 (physical feedback: low vs. high) × 2 (avatar design: normal vs. high intelligence) between-subjects experiment in IVR to test this assumption. In addition to subjective measures, we use heart rate and electrodermal activity to assess the strength of self-presence induced through the illusions."
article10,Using fMRI to Measure Stimulus Generalization of Software Notification to Security Warnings,"This paper examines how habituation to frequent software notifications may carry over to infrequent security warnings. This general process—known as stimulus generalization or simply generalization—is a well-established phenomenon in neurobiology that has clear implications for information security. Because software user interface guidelines call for visual consistency, software notifications and security warnings have a similar look and feel. Consequently, through frequent exposure to notifications, people may become habituated to security warnings they have never seen before. The objective of this paper to propose an fMRI experimental design to measure the extent to which this occurs. We also propose testing security warning designs that are resistant to generalization of habituation effects."
article11,Do We Protect What We Own?: A Proposed Neurophysiological Exploration of Workplace Information Protection Motivation,"Part-time and temporary employees and contractors become a major cybersecurity threat for organizations due to the ephemeral nature of their engagement. Compared with full-time employees, they may be less commited to the welfare of the organization and, therefore, less willing to engage in security recommendations to protect it. Perceived psychological ownership is an important factor that shapes employees’ security behaviors. The endowment effect also explains employees’ tendencies to overvalue information that belongs to them, and conversely, extend fewer protections to information that they view as belonging to others. Thus, employees may be more motivated to safeguard their own information than organizational information. From a principle-agent perspective, this study investigates how three types of employees perceive organizational and personal information, and how different employees make decisions about protecting their own versus organizational information."
article12,Investigating Phishing Susceptibility—An Analysis of Neural Measures,"Phishing is an attempt to acquire sensitive information from a user by malicious means. The losses due to phishing have exceeded a trillion dollars globally. In investigating phishing susceptibility, literature has largely examined structural and individual characteristics. Very little attention has been paid to neural measures within phishing contexts. In this paper, we explore the role of cognitive responses and correlated brain responses in phishing context. Such research is useful because a deeper understanding of persuasion techniques can inform the design of effective countermeasures for detecting and blocking phishing messages."
article13,Affective Information Processing of Fake News: Evidence from NeuroIS,"False information such as “fake news” threatens the credibility of social media and is widely believed to affect public opinion. So far, IS literature lacks a theoretical foundation on what leads humans to classify a news item as fake. In order to shed light on this question, we performed an experiment that involved 42 subjects with both eye tracking and heart rate measurements. We find that a lower heart rate variability and a higher relative number of eye fixations per second are associated with a higher probability of fake classification. Our study contributes to IS theory by providing evidence that the decision, if a news item is real or fake, is not purely cognitive, but also involves affective information processing. Thereby, it points towards novel strategies for identifying and preventing the spread of fake news in social media."
article14,What Can NeuroIS Learn from the Replication Crisis in Psychological Science?,"The Reproducibility Crisis is a phenomenon that has gained considerable attention in the psychological sciences. Scholars in these fields have found that many high profile findings are either difficult to reproduce or could not be replicated. These findings have ultimately encouraged researchers to adopt pre-registered results, replication in study design and open data. As an emerging field, NeuroIS has an opportunity to learn from this crisis and adopt new practices based on the lessons learned in the psychological sciences. We explored the current state of NeuroIS research from the perspective of reproducibility by conducting a survey of the extant NeuroIS literature. We conclude by suggesting two practices that the NeuroIS community can undertake to help address the replication problem."
article15,Techno-Unreliability: A Pilot Study in the Field,"We report on a pilot study, with the aim of investigating techno-unreliability in the field. Over the course of three days, we collected physiological data (heart rate) from four participants, which experienced manipulations that rendered a variety of work-related systems unusable. Although we found that it is feasible to also investigate technostress in this way in the field, more data is needed to interpret the captured physiological reactions. In particular, we need data that allows us to investigate stress appraisal, ideally at a sampling rate that is comparable to those that we get from capturing physiological data."
article16,Wavelet Transform Coherence: An Innovative Method to Investigate Social Interaction in NeuroIS,"Neuro-information system researchers called for the development of tools and methods of analysis that allows for the assessment of social interactions that considers the full range of dynamics and complexities. Recent work and progress in hyperscanning—the simultaneous recording of multiple subjects—offers the possibility to develop such methods and new research paradigms to respond to that need. Among these methods, Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC) analysis is gaining in popularity and accessibility. However, hyperscanning methods—including WTC— remain a challenging experimental paradigm and analysis method, requiring careful preparation of data and consideration of the constraints of each neuroimaging technique. This manuscript aims to introduce the Wavelet Transform Coherence method of analysis as an innovative approach to Neuro-Information Systems research. We present practical examples and results in order to highlight the potential and complexity of this approach."
article17,Towards a Software Architecture for Neurophysiological Experiments,"Despite their wide adoption for conducting experiments in numerous domains, neurophysiological measurements often are time consuming and challenging to interpret because of the inherent complexity of deriving measures from raw signal data and mapping measures to theoretical constructs. While significant efforts have been undertaken to support neurophysiological experiments, the existing software solutions are non-trivial to use because often these solutions are domain specific or their analysis processes are opaque to the researcher. This paper proposes an architecture for a software platform that supports experiments with multi-modal neurophysiological tools through extensible, transparent and repeatable data analysis and enables the comparison between data analysis processes to develop more robust measures. The identified requirements and the proposed architecture are intended to form a basis of a software platform capable of conducting experiments using neurophysiological tools applicable to various domains."
article18,Machine Learning Based Diagnosis of Diseases Using the Unfolded EEG Spectra: Towards an Intelligent Software Sensor,"In this research-in-progress work we sketch a roadmap for the development of a novel machine-learning-based EEG software sensor. In the first step we present the idea to unfold the EEG standard bandwidths in a more fine-graded equidistant 99-point spectrum to improve accuracy when diagnosing diseases. We use this novel pre-processing step prior to entering a Random Forests classifier. In the second step we evaluate the approach on alcoholism and epilepsy and demonstrate that the approach outperforms all benchmarks. The third step sketches a further improvement by replacing the hard-coded equidistant 99-point spectrum with a flexibly-grading spectrum. In the fourth step we combine the flexibly-grading EEG spectrum, the spatial locations of the EEG electrodes, and the EEG recording time to train an intelligent EEG software sensor using self-organizing feature mapping. Our work contributes to NeuroIS research by analyzing EEG as a bio-signal though a novel machine-learning approach."
article19,The Impact of Symmetric Web-Design: A Pilot Study,"In this research-in-progress paper we propose a pilot study to investigate the effect of symmetric web-design. Cognitive, affective, and behavioral impacts of symmetry are investigated using EEG, skin conductance, heart-rate measures, and a questionnaire on an experiment of 14 participants, each presented with 100 stimuli of symmetric (50) and asymmetric (50) conditions in a random order. We expect to observe a longer sustained posterior negativity in the Event-Related Potential (ERP), a higher emotional response, as well as a higher visual appeal for the symmetric condition. Results are currently being analyzed and will be presented at the conference."
article20,Search Results Viewing Behavior vis-à-vis Relevance Criteria,"We conducted a lab-based experiment to investigate relationship between multiple criteria used in information relevance judgments and eye fixation behavior on search engine results. We collected eye-tracking data and conducted gaze-cued retrospective think-aloud (RTA). Data from RTA was coded with criteria used by participants in judging search results as relevant. The criteria were analyzed in relation to search engine result page (SERP) sequence and result rank on SERPs. The results of our study aligned with previous research, showing the effect of result rank on SERPs. Our results newly showed that specific source and topicality were the two most often used criteria for relevance judgments. Specific source was the most often used criteria initially but was then surpassed by topicality on subsequent SERPs and on lower result ranks. On first SERPs, fixation duration was significantly longer on results judged on topicality than on specific source. Pupils dilated significantly on the top ranked result on most SERP pages."
article21,An Adaptive Cognitive Temporal-Causal Network Model of a Mindfulness Therapy Based on Humor,"In this paper the effect of a humor therapy is modeled based on a Network-Oriented Modeling approach. Humor therapy is a mindfulness therapy which has been used since many years ago, when Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi as a Persian scientist who used humor theory to distinguish one contagious disease from another, to make stressed individuals more relaxed. The presented adaptive temporal-causal network model addresses the computational modeling of humor therapy for a person who in the first step triggers two incongruent beliefs in order to get the humor from a humor context to overcome an ongoing stressful event. This happens by showing a comedy movie. As a result, the stress level in the body reduces. Hebbian learning is incorporated to strengthen the effect of the humor therapy."
article22,Neural Correlates of Dual Decision Processes: A Network-Based Meta-analysis,"It is well-received that human decision mechanism involves two processes: intuition and deliberation, which is also known as faster system 1 and slower system 2. A large volume of research has used this mechanism to interpret human decision behavior and the activation of associated bran regions in different scenarios. Recently, a trend of brain image research is to focus not on the role of individual brain areas but on the network of area connectivity. The purpose of this research is hence to explore how different brain regions are connected when these different decision processes are activated. In particular, we conduct a meta-analysis to build new knowledge on existing published primary research to construct neural networks associated with these dual processes. The social network analysis is used for this meta-analysis and results will be reported."
article23,Exploring the Neural Correlates of Visual Aesthetics on Websites,"Perceiving beauty typically provides pleasure through which it becomes a general human need. In the context of online shopping, websites should be designed, bearing in mind that users prefer websites that are visually pleasing. In recent research, website aesthetics have mostly been explored with qualitative self-reports measurements, eye-tracking devices, or even mathematical models. Moreover, also neuroscientific methods have been utilized to investigate websites’ aesthetics and beauty. Nevertheless there are only few studies that investigated the visual design of websites with neuroimaging tools, even though these neuroimaging studies might enable researchers to investigated unconscious cognitive processes. Against this background, this work in progress aims to open up fruitful avenues to measure website aesthetics and states hypotheses which brain regions are likely to be involved when it comes to the aesthetically pleasing perception of websites by users."
article24,Mitigating Information Overload in e-Commerce Interactions with Conversational Agents,"Information overload influences users’ satisfaction and performance when completing a complex task. In e-commerce interactions, this has the effect that customers’ decision making becomes confused, less accurate and less effective. For websites, numerous countermeasures to mitigate information overload have been presented, whereas not many attempts have been made to reduce cognitive load when conversational agents are used instead. Conversational agents are expected to increase the perceived overload due to the voice interface characteristics. In this pilot study, the cognitive load of subjects was measured during an online shopping task which required different custom shopping skills for Amazon Alexa. It was tested if the countermeasure filtered repetition can reduce subjects’ perceived overload when using the voice assistant and which load differences can be found in comparison to a shopping website. To measure the mental load, the skin conductance level was recorded."
article25,Positive Moods Can Encourage Inertial Decision Making: Evidence from Eye-Tracking Data,"We examine whether emotion can encourage inertial decision making, which is an emergent research topic in online shopping. Based on the information processing view, inertia is conceptualized as a decision process that involves repeated usage of a similar effortless information search pattern across multiple problems, and we propose that this conceptualization can be quantified using an eye-movement index based on the string-editing algorithm. We then examine whether positive moods, which have been shown to increase impulsive shopping, may promote inertia. Subjects, who either received positive moods priming or calculation (mood-suppressing) priming, participated in an eye-tracking experiment with multiattribute decision tasks presented in a web map format like the Google Maps. The results showed that positive moods increased process inertia. We conclude that inertia can be quantified according to the information processing view, and that happy consumers tend to repeatedly use an effortless information search pattern to evaluate multiple products."
article26,Application of NeuroIS Tools to Understand Cognitive Behaviors of Student Learners in Biochemistry,"Cognitive load has received increased focus as an area that can be more richly explored using neuroIS tools. This research study presents the application of electroencephalography and eye tracking technologies to examine cognitive load of student learners in biochemistry. In addition to leveraging the Pope Engagement Index and eye tracking analysis techniques, we seek better understanding of the relationship that various individual characteristics have with the level of cognitive load experienced. While this study focuses on a particular STEM student population as they manipulate various learning models, it has implications for further studies in human-computer interaction and other learning environments."
article27,Task Switching and Visual Discrimination in Pedestrian Mobile Multitasking: Influence of IT Mobile Task Type,"With the growing use of smartphones in our daily life, mobile multitasking has become a widespread (and often dangerous) behavior. Research on mobile multitasking thus far only focuses on a limited number of IT tasks that can be performed with a smartphone: talking, listening to music, and texting. Thus, we do not know the extent to which these results generalize to other types of mobile multitasking behaviors such as reading while walking and gaming while walking. Also, we do not know the extent to which motor movement through physical space (i.e., walking vs. only standing) affects this phenomena. The current paper reports on an ongoing research that explores these questions. Our preliminary results suggest that mobile and standing multitasking leads to the inability to perceive incoming stimuli. Gaming appears to be the most dangerous mobile multitasking task for pedestrians."
article28,Interpersonal EEG Synchrony While Listening to a Story Recorded Using Consumer-Grade EEG Devices,"Interpersonal EEG synchrony derived from the hyperscanning technique has the potential to reveal brain mechanisms beyond the border of traditional analysis within an individual subject. However, the inter-brain connectivity has not been fully investigated using wearable consumer-grade EEG devices which can enable a variety of application in a real-world scenario. In this study, we investigate interpersonal synchrony by capturing EEG signals using wearable EEG devices, from multiple participants (N = 6, 7, 15) who simultaneously listened to a novel being read to them. The results show that similar power-spectral patterns from neural responses evoked by perceiving the same auditory stimuli exhibit the synchrony, which is likely to have a transient characteristic rather than being stationary."
article29,Using Eye-Tracking for Visual Attention Feedback,"In the age of big data, decision-makers are confronted with enormous amounts of information coming from various resources at high velocity. However, humans have limited cognitive capabilities such as attentional resources. Inappropriate attentional resource allocation can lead to severe losses in performance. Nowadays, the usage of eye-tracking devices brings the opportunity to design neuro-adaptive information systems that support users in better managing their limited attentional resources. In this study, we investigated the design of an attentive information dashboard which provides visual attention feedback (VAF) as live biofeedback. Later, we examined how three different VAF types assist decision makers in their visual attention allocation (VAA) performance and focused attention while conducting a data exploration task. The results show that providing an individualized VAF as live biofeedback using real-time gaze data supports users in managing their attention better than general VAFs."
article30,Perturbation-Evoked Potentials: Future Usage in Human-Machine Interaction,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can be used to improve human-machine interactions (HMIs) by providing implicit information about the mental state. We introduce a brain activity, perturbation-evoked potentials (PEPs), that was not yet investigated in the context of BCIs although it has the required properties. An experimental setup for studying PEPs is proposed and validated and two possible use cases for this brain activity are introduced."
article31,Improved Calibration of Neurophysiological Measures Tools,"To carry out more reliable UX tests, it is necessary to analyze how neuro-physiological measurements are treated. In particular, the use of baseline, the neutral task that compares a subject to itself, has so far been the subject of little study in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to focus on using the baseline in a UX test context. Our main result is that we can improve the baseline procedure, which currently consists of doing one baseline task at the beginning. Indeed, in our research, the validity of this procedure was studied during the calibration of the EDA (Electrodermal Activity). We then discovered that a majority of our subjects had an increasing or decreasing trend throughout the experiment. To answer this problem we propose to move the location of this one baseline or add a second baseline at the end of the experiment."
article32,"On Using Python to Run, Analyze, and Decode EEG Experiments","As the NeuroIS field expands its scope to address more complex research questions with electroencephalography (EEG), there is greater need for EEG analysis capabilities that are relatively easy to implement and adapt to different protocols, while at the same time providing an open and standardized approach. We present a series of open source tools, based on the Python programming language, which are designed to facilitate the development of open and collaborative EEG research. As supplementary material, we demonstrate the implementation of these tools in a NeuroIS case study and provide files that can be adapted by others for NeuroIS EEG research."
article33,Brand Visual Eclipse (BVE): When the Brand Fixation Spent is Minimal in Relation to the Celebrity,"This study investigates overshadowing effect of a celebrity. A term brand visual eclipse (BVE) is coined, the BVE occurs when brand fixation spent is minimal of the celebrity fixation spent. High BVE occurs when brand receive less than or equal to twenty percent fixation spent of the celebrity; moderate BVE occurs when the brand receives more than twenty percent and less than or equal to eighty percent fixation spent of the celebrity fixation spent and low BVE occurs when brand receive more than eighty percent fixation spent of the celebrity fixation spent. Two product categories were analyzed (Detergent Bar Brand and Mobile Brand), based on eye tracking data, the results suggest that high eclipse was observed in both categories. The BVE can be used as an advertising effectiveness indicator based on biometric data. The data was collected (n = 30) using Tobii-X30 Hz and was analyzed using iMotions biometric platform."
article34,The Impact of Associative Coloring and Representational Formats on Decision-Making: An Eye-Tracking Study,"This research-in-progress paper presents our ongoing work on the effects of representational options of decision models on decision performance. With the help of eye-tracking, we want to investigate the influence of the color design of textual, graphical and tabular decision models on decision accuracy, efficiency, and cognitive load. For this purpose, we design a controlled experiment to test whether associative color-highlighting (red for negative decision outcome, green for a positive result) makes decision models easier to understand than monochromatic or non-associative color-highlighting."
article35,Impact of Physical Health and Exercise Activity on Online User Experience: Elderly People and High Risk for Diabetes,"This article studies how an individual’s physical wellbeing contributes to one’s online user experience. The study subjects were elderly people at high risk for type 2 diabetes. The results suggest that the web usage experience of these prediabetic individuals is related to their physical health status and level of physical activity. Those with a better physical health status were more likely to feel ease of orientation in their web usage, and those with more frequent regular physical activity were more likely to perceive pleasure in navigating the web. In practice, variation in physical health and activity levels between individuals could, and should. be addressed in designing systems and services. In more general, studying user experience on par with biochemical measurements provides an exciting combination of research methods and paves the way for new design practices."
article36,The Effect of Body Positions on Word-Recognition: A Multi-methods NeuroIS Study,"Numerous studies have shown that different body postures and positions can differently influence one’s physiology, motivation and emotion processes, and behavioral and cognitive performances. The varying level of autonomic activation in various body positions may explain the differing level of arousal in supine (Lay), seated (Sit), and standing (Stand) body positions. The present study compared for the first time the effect of these three body positions on word-recognition performance (i.e., response accuracy and response time) while simultaneously using electroencephalography (EEG) to watch the brain at work. No significant difference was found among the three body positions for response accuracy. However, the mean response time was significantly faster for the Hit (correct judgment of the repetition of a word-stimulus) response outcome category in the Sit position compared to the Stand position. Moreover, the mean response time was slower for the Miss (incorrect judgment of the repetition of a word-stimulus) category in the Lay position compared to the Sit position. EEG data analysis further revealed interesting trends for the brain potential amplitudes at 180 ms post-stimulus. The amplitude corresponding to the Miss category was significantly different from the Correct rejection category in the Stand position at this timepoint. More importantly though, the differences in brain potential amplitudes between the Miss and the other three categories (Hit, Correct rejection, and False alarm) in the Lay position around this timepoint (180 ms) could be interpreted as a potential neurophysiological correlate underlying the prolonged response time for the Miss category in the Lay position. Possibly, this phenomenon can be linked with the well-known N200 event-related potential (ERP) component."
article37,The Relationships Between Emotional States and Information Processing Strategies in IS Decision Support—A NeuroIS Approach,"In this Work-in-Progress report, we describe an innovative experiment design for investigating the potential relationships between IS users’ emotional states (positive vs. negative) and their information processing strategies (automatic processing vs. controlled processing) during decision makings in an IS decision support environment. In the extant literature studying this topic, the users’ emotional states are usually determined by self-report or mental cue induction, and their information processing strategies by self-report or experiment task performance. In this paper, we describe an experiment design that utilizes neural and psychophysiological signals from the users to infer their emotional states and information processing strategies in real time. Our results will provide additional empirical evidence that are objective and accurate to this significant open research question."
article38,Improving Knowledge Acquisition from Informational Websites: A NeuroIS Study,"This research investigates the relationship between the relevance of website imagery with the given text, emotions and cognition and in return how those constructs influence knowledge acquisition and willingness of website revisits of online users. It particularly examines the moderating role of need-for-cognition on the relationship between website stimuli, emotion and cognition. We conducted lab experiments using electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the phenomenon. The initial phase of data collection has been completed. We hope to contribute to NeuroIS literature. Specifically, that examines the role of website design for emotional and cognitive responses and their relationship with online users’ knowledge acquisition and their willingness to revisit websites."
article39,Adaptation of Visual Attention: Effects of Information Presentation in Idea Selection Processes,"Idea submissions in innovation contests contain a variety of information as e.g., the idea description, information on its contributor or feedback by the crowd. Raters might perceive and attend to these sources of information differently, which potentially influences the selection of the best ideas. Up to now, however, we know little about the extent to which the visual attention to such information changes during the idea selection process and what impact such changes might have on the outcome of idea selection. The goal of our experiment is to investigate the effect of two idea presentation modes on changes in visual attention to idea attributes, measured with fixations using eye-tracking over time. Preliminary results on a sample of 30 participants show that visual attention to idea attributes decreases rapidly after participants saw the first 8 ideas."
article40,FITradeoff Decision Support System: An Exploratory Study with Neuroscience Tools,"Multicriteria problems are present in several contexts and are often complex. To support the decision maker, decision support systems (DSS) have been developed. FITradeoff is a DSS focused on multicriteria additive problems and has a flexible and interactive approach. This study aimed to investigate how engagement and cognitive load is evoked during the use of DSS for different types of problems. It is a work in progress that seeks to raise hypotheses to be tested to promote changes in the DSS and generate recommendations for the decision analyst to make the experience with DSS and the whole decision-making process more efficient and effective."
